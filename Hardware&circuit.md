 //Hardware
Hardware Components Required:
1.ESP8266 (NodeMCU/ESP-01)
2.HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor â€“ For distance measurement
3.Buzzer and Vibration Motor â€“ To alert the user
5.Resistors (1kÎ©, 330Î©) â€“ For buzzer/motor control
6.Battery Pack (18650 Li-Ion or Power Bank) â€“ To power the system
7.Jumper Wires
